	addon_description=_("""FreeRadio is an internet radio add-on for NVDA that provides seamless access to thousands of stations via the Radio Browser open directory. It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station audio profiles. Playback is handled by a prioritised backend chain (BASS, VLC, PotPlayer, Windows Media Player) with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),

**Scheduler and Timer Fixes**
**Scheduled Recordings**
- Day selection is now available in single-recording mode as well as recurring mode. Selecting multiple days creates a separate scheduled entry for each day, with each entry automatically placed on the next upcoming occurrence of that day.
- Removed the "time has passed today" warning; entries are now silently moved to the correct future date when the selected time has already passed.
- Fixed a bug where restarting NVDA during an active weekly recording would create an additional duplicate entry in both the schedule list and the JSON file on every restart. The next recurrence is now only queued after the current recording has fully completed.
- Removed misplaced code that was incorrectly rebuilding the station list on every keystroke in the favourites filter field.
**Timers**
- Adding a new timer is now blocked if another timer already exists at the same time, regardless of whether it is a start alarm or a sleep timer. The user is informed of the conflict and prompted to remove the existing entry first.
