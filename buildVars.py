It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station audio profiles. Playback is handled by a prioritised backend chain (BASS, VLC, PotPlayer, Windows Media Player) with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),

### New Features

- **Time-shift buffer**: Rewind and fast-forward live radio like a DVR, using a rolling ~10-minute buffer. Enable it from Settings or toggle it instantly with `Ctrl+Win+T`. Rewind 15 seconds with `Ctrl+Win+J`; fast-forward 15 seconds with `Ctrl+Win+K` — reaching the live edge automatically returns you to normal live playback.
- Time-shift now supports **HLS (`.m3u8`) stations** in addition to plain HTTP/HTTPS and Shoutcast/Icecast (ICY) streams — segments are downloaded and reassembled into the same rewindable buffer.

### Fixes

- Fixed time-shift capture (and recording) failing with an SSL certificate error on stations whose server presents an expired or otherwise invalid TLS certificate.

### Documentation

- Added a full "Time-Shift (Rewind Live Radio)" section to the README, plus new shortcut and settings table entries.
